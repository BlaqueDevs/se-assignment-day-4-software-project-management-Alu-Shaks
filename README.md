# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
It is important so as to build stakeholder satisfaction, for cost and resource management and increase competitive advantage in the market.
Develop a project schedule to keep the project in check, ensure there's risk management .


## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Drafting and realising the budget to ensure success. Ensure resource and time consciousness. Developing a project schedule, following through the software development cycle are some of the strategies used to prevent budget overruns.


## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Feature                 Agile                            Waterfall
Approach        iterative and incremental          sequential and linear
Flexibility     flexible                           fixed 
delivery        frequent small releases            single final release

Agile:
advantages- quickly adapts to changing requirements, delivers a working software faster.
disadvantages- requires a strong team co-ordination, unideal for project with strict compliance.

Waterfall:
advantages- well-structured with a clear documentation, relatively easier to manage costs and timelines.
disadvantages- difficulty in adapting to changing requirements, can result in longer delivery times.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more useful in flexible projects while waterfall is more useful in well-defined projects. Agile examples: mobile applications and game developments; Waterfall examples: government projects and medical software.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Having a quality assuarance officer with a well laid project plan.
Having automated testing.
Continuous integration and development.
User Acceptance Testing.
It is important to maintain increase standards to be in line with international standards. It enhances customer satisfaction and increases efficiency.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining your project scope in order to know how and when to do the software development activities in the life cycle. The Work Breakdown Structure is used to breakdown a large task to smaller tasks in order to be managed effectively. It is useful for it is used to define goals and skillfully manage them.


## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
It improves time management and resource use.
Reduces software development delays.

Gantt chart assists in: visual representation of organisation, helps to align the different departments involoved in the development of software and tracks progress.


## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
1. Data inconsistency
2. Security issues

Enhances user satisfaction when data integrity is achieved. Confidence towards the software security-wise is upholded by the users.


## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
The functional requirements guide in aligning the software to the user's needs rather than giving a wide scope of what they might not even need.
It allows for efficiency and effectiveness- using resources sparingly while being able to achieve success of the software.
It also provides a clear roadmap to follow for the software development team.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?


## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
A unique User Interface and User Experience.
AI powered automation.
Integration with Application Programming Interface.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Customer demands
Reports from statistical institutions
Analyses from competitors


## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
It influences adaptations hence maintaining relevance.
It influences choice of your software instead of other similar ones.
It influences growth of the software in the market.
